## Next steps

* Pages (probably using `pages/single-page.js`)
* Settings file (generic API URL, eg)
* Caching of API content
  * ...and invalidation thereof
* Featured image parsing (when present)
* Cleaning HTML out of rendered titles
* Routing for all the things
* Custom posts (stories, Evans movies, ...)
* Running on Apache or nginx
* ...what am I missing?
